This file contains a list of things to be done as well some open issues (questions) related to design/implementation.

TODO:

0- Remove "common" file (put inside class)
1- Add individual tags IPTC and XMP (and more for EXIF)
2- Get properties like 'width' and 'height' from caps
3- Review the code (in order to move to gst-plugins-good)
4- Document how the plugin works (atchitecture and interaction beteween modules)

OPEN ISSUES:

1- What is (How) the best way to delete some tag?
2- How to change metadata when the orignal image was modified.
  ex: file.jpeg has XMP, then we do filesrc ! metadataparse ! jpegdec ! pngenc ! metadatamux ! files
  is the metadata still valid? which fields are no valid anymore?
3- Add GST_TYPE_FRACTION support for GStreamer TAGS
4- After decided issue (4) put more things to gstmetadatacommon (or else create a Class)

KNOWN BUGS

1- exposure-time, exposure-program and fnumber can't be read from a file saved from scratch (whithout WHOLE_CHUNK from previous file)
