This file contains a list of things to be done as well some open issues (questions) related to design/implementation.

INFO:

1- to see what tags are mapped so far run 'grep -n GST_TAG *.[ch]' into this folder.

TODO:

1- Add more individual tags to XMP, EXIF and IPTC
2- Get properties like 'width' and 'height' from caps
3- Review the code (in order to move to gst-plugins-good)
4- Document how the plugin works (atchitecture and interaction beteween modules)
5- Improve the test application (to save also in png and to make it possible to set the metadata elements properties)

OPEN ISSUES:

1- What is (How) the best way to delete some tag?
2- How to change metadata when the orignal image was modified.
  ex: file.jpeg has XMP, then we do filesrc ! metadataparse ! jpegdec ! pngenc ! metadatamux ! files
  is the metadata still valid? which fields are no valid anymore?
3- In EXIF, how to make sure we are compliant with the specification when adding some tag? For example, we are not considerinb what are mandatory (or optional) IFDs for tags.
4- Add GST_TYPE_FRACTION support for GStreamer TAGS
5- currently, in JPEG files, if there is a Photoshop segment, everything inside it but IPTC will be lost. From the point of view of implementation it is easy, but I still don't now how to solve from the point of view of "designing". Anyway I think it is not so important.
6- language is not considered in XMP (How to do it with GStreamer?)
7- Add a helper function that convert from value to string. For example, aperture-size is 2.7 and the app wants to show "f/2.7", 'contrast' is a range and the app wants to show as "Normal", "Soft", "Hard". For the time being it is up to the APP to make this conversion.

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=112272&aid=1884609&group_id=12272

1- EXIF_TAG_ISO_SPEED_RATINGS should be in EXIF_IFD_EXIF
2- EXIF_TAG_ISO_SPEED_RATINGS is not inserted anyway
