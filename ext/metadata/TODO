This file contains a list of things to be done as well some open issues (questions) related to design/implementation.

INFO:

1- I (Edgard Lima - alima - edgard.lima@indt.org.br) will be on vacation until 05-Jan-2008. After that I will be back on it.
2- to see what tags are mapped so far run 'grep -n GST_TAG *.[ch]' into this folder.

TODO:

1- Add individual XMP tags (and more for EXIF and IPTC)
2- Get properties like 'width' and 'height' from caps
3- Review the code (in order to move to gst-plugins-good)
4- Document how the plugin works (atchitecture and interaction beteween modules)

OPEN ISSUES:

1- What is (How) the best way to delete some tag?
2- How to change metadata when the orignal image was modified.
  ex: file.jpeg has XMP, then we do filesrc ! metadataparse ! jpegdec ! pngenc ! metadatamux ! files
  is the metadata still valid? which fields are no valid anymore?
3- Add GST_TYPE_FRACTION support for GStreamer TAGS
4- currently, in JPEG files, if there is a Photoshop segment, everything inside it but IPTC will be lost. From the point of view of implementation it is easy, but I still don't now how to solve from the point of view of "designing". Anyway I think it is not so important.

KNOWN BUGS

1- exposure-time, exposure-program and fnumber can't be read from a file saved from scratch (whithout WHOLE_CHUNK from previous file)
  I believe it is a bug in libexif
