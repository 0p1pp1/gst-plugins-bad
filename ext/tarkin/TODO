Most important things:

 - the entropy coder, replace static huffman
 - clean up the pnsr tools
 - write docs and do some performance analysis, compare to other codecs
 - think about a multiresolution multidimensional motion flow detection scheme,
    Marco posted a good paper comparing different algorithms to do this


Open bugs and stuff required to fix them:

 - wavelet xform bug at short rows, see workaround in wavelet_xform.c
 - (4,x) and (x,4) wavelet implementations have a bug which causes round-off 
    errors in the two least significand bits


Wavelet-related TODO's:

 - remove unecessairy copying in inverse xform
 - improve truncation table setup
 - try other approaches to encode coefficients, jack was talking about VQ
    and reuse vorbis code
 - write avitotarkin/quicktimetotarkin/mpegtotarkin/player/recorder
    (a libsndfile/libaudiofile/libao alike video library would be great !)
 - profile
 - add special transform functions for large strides to prevent cache misses
 - mmx/3dnow/sse/altivec


Other:

 - u and v buffers could get quarter size already at color conversion
    this would speed up the whole algorithm; perhaps this should get
    configurable
 - fast internal 16bitY/U/V->15/16bitRGB for display could make sense
 - the wavelet codec could be used for still image compression too
    (we just have to define a file format with all goodies you can imagine;) 
 - to make it perfect someone has to write a good bilevel compressor and
    mask seperation algorithm
