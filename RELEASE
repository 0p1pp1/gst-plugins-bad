Release notes for GStreamer Bad Plugins 1.7.90

The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the stable
1.8 release series. The 1.8 release series is adding new features on top of
the 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release
series of the GStreamer multimedia framework.


Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided separately
during the stable 1.8 release series.


"That an accusation?"


No perfectly groomed moustache or any amount of fine clothing is going to
cover up the truth - these plugins are Bad with a capital B.
They look fine on the outside, and might even appear to get the job done, but
at the end of the day they're a black sheep. Without a golden-haired angel
to watch over them, they'll probably land in an unmarked grave at the final
showdown.


Don't bug us about their quality - exercise your Free Software rights,
patch up the offender and send us the patch on the fastest steed you can
steal from the Confederates. Because you see, in this world, there's two
kinds of people, my friend: those with loaded guns and those who dig.
You dig.


This module contains a set of plugins that aren't up to par compared to the
rest.  They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing something
- be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a real live
maintainer, or some actual wide use.  If the blanks are filled in they might be
upgraded to become part of either gst-plugins-good or gst-plugins-ugly,
depending on the other factors.
If the plugins break, you can't complain - instead, you can fix the
problem and send us a patch, or bribe someone into fixing them for you.
New contributors can start here for things to work on.


Other modules containing plugins are:


gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plugins
gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plugins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plugins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-libav
contains a set of codecs plugins based on libav (formerly gst-ffmpeg)
