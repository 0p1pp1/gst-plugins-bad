GStreamer 0.3.2 "Do-B-day" released

Release Notes

   The  GStreamer  team  is  happy  to  announce  another  release of the
   GStreamer  streaming-media  framework. GStreamer now contains close to
   100  plugins for reading, writing and manipulating audio and video. We
   are  rapidly  approaching  a  stable  set  of  libraries.  Our  sample
   applications are, however, still under development.

   We  now have a gst-all module prepared that includes all of our source
   modules in one easy-to-compile package.

Future Plans

   Our goal for the next release is stabilizing and improving the current
   feature  set  of  GStreamer further, including introducing an improved
   autoplugger  module for even better handling of media formats. We will
   also  focus  more  attention at our media player sample application as
   this is the application most users and developers probably will use to
   get aquinted with the framework.

   For help building GStreamer, take a look at our build help document.

   http://gstreamer.net/.

   GStreamer  is  hosted on SourceForge, so support requests and bugs may
   be filed as usual. Interested developers of the core library, plugins,
   and  applications  should  subscribe  to  the gstreamer-devel list. If
   there is sufficient interest we will create more lists as necessary.

   We  are  still  looking for people with access to Solaris, HP-UX, Irix
   and  True64  that  would  be  willing  to  try  building  and  testing
   GStreamer. Patches fixing such problems are also more than welcome.
