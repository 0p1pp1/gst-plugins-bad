GStreamer: Release notes for GStreamer Plugins 0.8.3 "Water"
        

The GStreamer team is happy to announce a new release
in the 0.8.x stable series of the GStreamer Plugins.


The 0.8.x series is a stable series aimed at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.6.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.6.x series.


This module contains plugins providing media encoding and decoding,
conversion, effects, and other elements that provide actual media
handling functionality to the core.  You need the GStreamer core module
to make them work.  The versions do not need to match exactly, as long
as all of them are in the 0.8.x series.


The FFmpeg-based decoder element has been moved to its own module.  If you
want support for a lot of popular video formats, you need to install this
module along with the GStreamer Core and Plugins.  An FFmpeg-based colorspace
element has been added to the Plugins however.
