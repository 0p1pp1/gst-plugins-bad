                GStreamer "30 Second Frenchman" 0.3.4 released

                                 RELEASE NOTES

   The  GStreamer  team  is  happy  to  announce  another  release of the
   GStreamer streaming-media framework.

Focus of this release

   This release fixes a few developer usability issues.

   A  few  of  the  API  functions  have  been  changed  to  offer better
   functionality  and  to  be  more consistent with other toolkits (GLib,
   GTK).
   Sample changes:
     * gst_elementfactory_make to gst_element_factory_make
     * GST_PADTEMPLATE_* to GST_PAD_TEMPLATE_*

   This  release  of  GStreamer  has  been  primarily  made in support of
   RhythmBox. It should really work with their upcoming 0.2.0 release.

   The gst-launch parsing has been bisonified. This allows for better and
   more consistent command-line parsing. Accordingly, some changes in the
   dynamic pad treatment have been made as well.
   The registry handling has been changed. gst-register will now write to
   a  local  registry  (in  ~/.gstreamer/reg.xml)  if  it  does  not have
   permissions  to  write to the global registry. Normal applications not
   running as root will prefer this local registry if it exists, and fall
   back to the global otherwise.
   Also,  a --gst-registry option has been added to all gst applications.
   If  this  is  specified,  then  the  application  will  ONLY  use this
   registry.  This  is  useful  for testsuites inside the core as well as
   general testing of plugins.

   GStreamer  is  now  in  Gnome's  Bugzilla. Please file bugs against us
   there whenever you find them !

Changes in the 0.3.x tree

   The  0.3.x  tree  is  our first tree using GLib 2.0 and libxml2 as the
   sole  compile  platform.  We  have  also  started  including  all  our
   documentation  in our RPMS starting this tree. People wanting to build
   GStreamer themselves with documentation should look at the DOCBUILDING
   file  for  some  information on what packages are needed to build that
   successfully.

   Another  new  feature  of  this  release  tree  is  the gst-launch-ext
   command-line  application.  It  uses predefined pipelines to play back
   media  files  based on their file extension. This means that you don't
   need  to construct your own pipelines using gst-launch if all you want
   to  do  is  play  a  file. Just type gst-launch-ext [filename] and the
   audiofile  or movie plays for you. This of course also being a work in
   progress  means  that sometimes it might decide on the wrong pipeline,
   or cause jitter, as well as random headaches.

   For help building GStreamer, take a look at our [1]build help document
   .

Updates and Enhancements in this release

     * Improved API naming
     * New  registry  handling,  allowing  for global, local or specified
       registry
     * bison parser
     * gst-launch-ext dynamic pad fixes
     * various fixes in mad and vorbisdec for RhythmBox

Previously, in the 0.3.x tree

     * devhelp documentation
     * New and improved Props API
     * New master clock system
     * dxr3 plugin
     * libcolorspace plugin
     * Full dparams documentation
     * All functions documented (551 functions documented)
     * Python bindings
     * Portability fixes (no more C++ // style comments)
     * a52dec plugin updated to a52dec 0.7.3 API
     * gnome-vfs plugin updated to new seek api
     * Misc bug and caps fixes
     * SPEC files improvements

   More  details on these features can be found on the project's website,
   [2]http://gstreamer.net/.   Source   tarballs  are  also  mirrored  at
   [3]http://gstreamer.net/releases/current/src/.  If you use Red Hat (or
   possibly  other  RPM-based  systems),  RPMs for both GStreamer itself,
   external  libraries and development tools not included in the standard
   reference    distribution    (RedHat    7.2)    can    be   found   in
   [4]http://gstreamer.net/releases/current/redhat.

   GStreamer  is  hosted on SourceForge, so support requests and bugs may
   be filed as usual. Interested developers of the core library, plugins,
   and  applications  should  subscribe  to  the gstreamer-devel list. If
   there is sufficient interest we will create more lists as necessary.

   We  are  still  looking for people with access to Solaris, HP-UX, Irix
   and  True64  that  would  be  willing  to  try  building  and  testing
   GStreamer. Patches fixing such problems are also more than welcome.
