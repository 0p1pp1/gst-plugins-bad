            GStreamer "Desperately Seeking Sexiness" 0.4.0 released

   The  GStreamer  team  is  happy  to  announce  another  release of the
   GStreamer  streaming-media framework. We are quickly moving forward at
   this  time  and more and more applications using GStreamer are popping
   up.  Please  see  the  [1]release  page for availability of source and
   binary packages.

Updates and Enhancements

  General

     * Graphical pipeline editor (gst-editor) ported to GNOME 2.0
     * Autobuild system using [2]bitches to generate good RPMs
     * Apt  for  rpm repository for GStreamer and plug-in dependencies on
       RedHat  7.2  and  7.3,  for  both  Ximian  Red-Carpet  Gnome 2 and
       Gnomehide. See [3]http://gstreamer.net/releases/redhat/
     * Red-Carpet GStreamer channel under construction.
     * GConf schemas distributed for centralised sink settings
     * Moved  to  [4]http://bugzilla.gnome.org/ for bug reports. Bugzilla
       is  more  convenient  than SourceForge's system, and Gnome already
       has a system running. Thanks to Gnome for the support.
     * Created  a  gst-feedback script to gather system information to be
       added to a bug report for better debugging.

  Core

     * New much improved registry system implemented.
     * New  event-driven  seek  support.  Event system is now working and
       implemented
     * Header files are now in a versioned directory to ease build pains.
     * Improvements and bugfixes todparams.
     * Docs updated, registry and system clock documentation added

Known Issues

   GStreamer  currently  ships  with  two  schedulers,  named 'basic' and
   'standard'. Basic is the one we have been shipping for a long time now
   and  is  still  the default in GStreamer 0.4.0. There are however some
   limitations and threadrelated bugs in basic. These limitations are not
   present  in  standard,  but  unfortunately standard does not work with
   i686  glibc  atm  due  to  differences  in the way threads are handled
   compared  to  other  architectures  including i386. We hope to get the
   remaining  issues  in  standard  fixed  before  0.4.1  and use that as
   default.

   As  for the bugs in basic we did not feel they warranted not releasing
   0.4.0  as  they  are  rather  obscure.  For  instance if you are using
   Rhythmbox  you  will  need  to  be  playing  over 500 songs nonstop to
   trigger it.

   If  you  want  to  test  the  standard  scheduler,  run your GStreamer
   application with --gst-scheduler=standard

GStreamer Homepage

   More  details on these features can be found on the project's website,
   [8]http://gstreamer.net/.

Support

   We  use  [9]Gnome's Bugzilla for bug reports and feature requests. The
   "product  name"  is  GStreamer  (capital  G).  Please do the following
   before writing a bug report :
gst-feedback > feedback 2>&1

   and  attach  the  file  "feedback" to your bug report, so that we have
   some information useful in the debugging process.

Developers

   GStreamer  is [10]hosted on SourceForge. All code is in CVS and can be
   checked  out  from  there.  Interested developers of the core library,
   plug-ins,  and  applications  should  subscribe to the gstreamer-devel
   list.  If  there  is  sufficient interest we will create more lists as
   necessary.

   We  are  still  looking for people with access to Solaris, HP-UX, Irix
   and  True64  that  would  be  willing  to  try  building  and  testing
   GStreamer. Patches fixing such problems are also more than welcome.
