Warning !!! most of those item are probably obsolete :

configure.ac / build :
* version the element check m4
* check GST_* in configure.ac, there is too much in it
* check if we can drop some of the AC_SUBST's for libs and cflags

plugins :
* ext/a52dec	check options, it has some arch stuff and some opti stuff that looks dodgy
* ext/arts[d]	need a good onceover
* ext/jack	plugin is rotten, won't work with current jack versions
* ext/ladspa	add header check stuff and dir stuff
* ext/mpeg2dec	what to do with the perftest ?
* ext/sdl	check SDL optimisation flags
* gst/festival	should have checks and stuff and added properly
* gst/wavenc	merge gst/wavenc/riff.h and gst-libs/gst/riff/riff-ids.h
* sys/qcam	it includes source of the qcam package that might be librified

* gst-libs/gst/riff: do we need those cflags ?

packaging :
* work on spec file :
  add plugins with AC stuff (maybe from bits ?)
  write script that builds rpm's one from one
  get postun script right; gstreamer-register should be installed for example
