  it better ;)

* check GST_* in configure.ac, there is too much in it

* work on spec file :
  add plugins with AC stuff (maybe from bits ?)

  looks dodgy

* riff: do we need those cflags ?

* festival should have checks and stuff and added properly

* fix ffmpeg

* add ladspa header check stuff and dir stuff

* make sidplay stuff ok, the source is on the net ;)
