* check qcam plugin; it includes source of the qcam package that might
  be librified

* check xvideo; the flags need better handling but first try to understand
  it better ;)

* check SDL optimisation flags

* check GST_* in configure.ac, there is too much in it

* decide where to put the control lib

* work on spec file :
  add plugins with AC stuff (maybe from bits ?)
  write script that builds rpm's one from one
  get postun script right; gstreamer-register should be installed for example

* check options in a52, it has some arch stuff and some opti stuff that 
  looks dodgy

* what to do with the perftest in mpeg2dec ?

* riff: do we need those cflags ?

* festival should have checks and stuff and added properly

* fix ffmpeg
