List of ported plugins (update when you commit a ported plugin):
effectv (wim)
mad	(wim)
videofilter (wim)

osssink is partially done in the threaded branch (wim)

- Remember that some plugins are already ported and now in the gst-plugins-base module.

When you have ported a plugin remember to copy the relevant parts from configure.ac.orig into configure.ac and re-enable it in the Makefile.am files.
