GSTREAMER 1.18 RELEASE NOTES


THESE RELEASE NOTES ARE A PLACEHOLDER, PLEASE BEAR WITH US WHILE WE
FINISH WRITING UP THE REAL THING.

GStreamer 1.18.0 has not yet been released. It is scheduled for release
in summer 2020 now.

1.17.x is the unstable development series that is currently being
developed in the git master branch and which will eventually result in
1.18, and 1.17.2 is the current development release in that series.

The schedule for the 1.18 development cycle is yet to be confirmed, but
it is expected that feature freeze will be in June/July 2020, followed
by several 1.17 pre-releases and then a new 1.18 stable release in
July/August 2020.

1.18 will be backwards-compatible to the stable 1.16, 1.14, 1.12, 1.10,
1.8, 1.6, 1.4, 1.2 and 1.0 release series.

See https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/1.18/ for the latest
version of this document.

Miscellaneous performance and memory optimisations

As always there have been many performance and memory usage improvements

mentioned elsewhere so won’t be repeated here.

The following list is only a small snapshot of some of the more
interesting optimisations that haven’t been mentioned in other contexts

Build and Dependencies

-   The Autotools build system has finally been removed in favour of the
    Meson build system. Developers who currently use gst-uninstalled
    should move to gst-build.

-   API and plugin documentation are no longer built with gtk_doc. The
    gtk_doc documentation has been removed in favour of a new unified
    documentation module built with hotdoc. The intention is to
    distribute the generated documentation in form of tarballs alongside
    releases.

-   FIXME

Cerbero

Cerbero is a meta build system used to build GStreamer plus dependencies
on platforms where dependencies are not readily available, such as
Windows, Android, iOS and macOS.

Cerbero has seen a number of improvements:

-   FIXME


Platform-specific changes and improvements

… and many others who have contributed bug reports, translations, sent
suggestions or helped testing.


Stable 1.18 branch

After the 1.18.0 release there will be several 1.18.x bug-fix releases
which will contain bug fixes which have been deemed suitable for a
stable branch, but no new features or intrusive changes will be added to
a bug-fix release usually. The 1.18.x bug-fix releases will be made from
the git 1.18 branch, which will be a stable branch.

1.18.0

1.18.0 has not been released yet.


Known Issues

-   FIXME


Schedule for 1.20

Our next major feature release will be 1.20, and 1.19 will be the
unstable development version leading up to the stable 1.20 release. The
development of 1.19/1.20 will happen in the git master branch.

The plan for the 1.20 development cycle is yet to be confirmed.

1.20 will be backwards-compatible to the stable 1.18, 1.16, 1.14, 1.12,
1.10, 1.8, 1.6, 1.4, 1.2 and 1.0 release series.
