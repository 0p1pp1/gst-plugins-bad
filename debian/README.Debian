   gstreamer-plugin-libs-dev  headers for -plugin-libs libs

apps:

   gstreamer-plugin-apps   small script apps to using gst-launch


Notes:


Various plugins in the upstream source are not yet packaged.  This is
most likely due to:

  * upstream considers them too unstable
  * libraries they depend on are not are yet in Debian


Your favorite codec isn't wrapped as a plugin?  External programs can be
used to process streams.  Take a look at "pipefilter" element or try
something like this:

  $ mkfifo fifo
  $ gst-launch myaudiosrc ! disksink location=fifo &
  $ cat fifo | my_encoder > output_file


mp3 encoding plugins are NOT packaged.  Specifically, the LAME plugin is
NOT packaged due to Debian not including the LAME libraries.  Please see
the following links for more information:

  http://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/unable-to-package
  http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0006/msg01213.html
  http://www.mp3dev.org/

It was packaged prior to 0.3.3-2.  In case anyone is interested the
unsupported diff might be found at:

Ogg Vorbis provides a good alternative to mp3s.  Try the
gstreamer-vorbis package.  For more information:
