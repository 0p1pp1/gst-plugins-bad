	* configure.ac: X_DISPLAY_MISSING is set to 1 if AC_PATH_XTRA fails to
	find X development files. I don't understand the previous tests and
	they fail on my debian/ppc unstable. This one works.
	* examples/gstplay/player.c: (main): Set the pipeline to READY before
	exiting.
	* gst-libs/gst/play/gstplay.c: (gst_play_get_length_callback),
	(gst_play_set_video_sink), (gst_play_set_audio_sink),
	(gst_play_set_visualization): Add some safety checks in set_ methods
	and state_change. This was throwing some ugly CRITICAL messages when
	pipeline was getting disposed and casts were failing.

	* configure.ac:
	  Improve mpeg2enc detection. This is for distributions that do
	  ship mjpegtools, but without mpeg2enc. Also does object check
	  for might there ever be ABI incompatibility.
	* ext/mpeg2enc/gstmpeg2enc.cc:
	  Add Andrew as second maintainer (he's helping me), and also add
	  an error if no caps was set. This happens if I pull before capsnego
	  and that's something I should solve sometime else.
	* gst/matroska/matroska-demux.c:
	(gst_matroska_demux_parse_blockgroup):
	  Fix time parsing.
	* gst/matroska/matroska-mux.c: (gst_matroska_mux_audio_pad_link),
	(gst_matroska_mux_track_header):
	  Add caps to templates.
	* gst/mpegaudioparse/gstmpegaudioparse.c: (mp3_sink_factory):
	  Add mpegversion=1 to prevent confusion with MPEG/AAC.
	* gst/mpegstream/gstmpegdemux.c:
	  Remove layer since it causes warnings about unfixed caps.
	* gst/videotestsrc/gstvideotestsrc.c: (gst_videotestsrc_get):
	  Fix obvious typo (we error out if caps were set, we should of
	  course error out if *no* caps were set).
	* sys/oss/gstosselement.c: (gst_osselement_convert):
	  Fix format conversion, we confused bits/bytes.
	* sys/oss/gstosselement.h:
	  Improve documentation for 'bps'.
	* sys/v4l/TODO:
	  Remove stuff about plugins that need removing - this was done
	  ages ago.
	* sys/v4l/gstv4lmjpegsrc.c: (gst_v4lmjpegsrc_init),
	(gst_v4lmjpegsrc_src_convert), (gst_v4lmjpegsrc_src_query):
	* sys/v4l/gstv4lsrc.c: (gst_v4lsrc_init), (gst_v4lsrc_src_convert),
	(gst_v4lsrc_src_query):
	* sys/v4l2/gstv4l2src.c: (gst_v4l2src_init),
	(gst_v4l2src_src_convert), (gst_v4l2src_src_query):
	  Add get_query_types(), get_formats() and query() functions.
