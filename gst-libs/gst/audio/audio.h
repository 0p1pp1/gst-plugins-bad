/* For people that are looking at this source: the purpose of these defines is
 * to make GstCaps a bit easier, in that you don't have to know all of the
 * properties that need to be defined. you can just use these macros. currently
 * (8/01) the only plugins that use these are the passthrough, speed, volume,
 * adder, and [de]interleave plugins. These are for convenience only, and do not
 * specify the 'limits' of GStreamer. you might also use these definitions as a
 * base for making your own caps, if need be.
 *
 * For example, to make a source pad that can output streams of either mono
 * float or any channel int:
 *
 *  template = gst_pad_template_new
 *    ("sink", GST_PAD_SINK, GST_PAD_ALWAYS,
 *    gst_caps_append(gst_caps_new ("sink_int",  "audio/x-raw-int",
 *                                  GST_AUDIO_INT_PAD_TEMPLATE_PROPS),
 *                    gst_caps_new ("sink_float", "audio/x-raw-float",
 *                                  GST_AUDIO_FLOAT_PAD_TEMPLATE_PROPS)),
 *    NULL);
 *
 *  sinkpad = gst_pad_new_from_template(template, "sink");
